Zerava is a lightweight cybersecurity platform designed to help startups and small teams identify, analyze, and remediate critical security risks before they lead to costly breaches. It provides enterprise-grade security insights in a startup-friendly, actionable format.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Startups and small businesses are high-value targets for cyberattacks but typically lack:

* Dedicated security personnel
* Time or expertise to interpret technical findings
* Budget for enterprise-level security tools

Existing enterprise tools are often:

* **Expensive** — SaaS subscriptions or enterprise-grade solutions
* **Complex** — require deep technical knowledge to configure and interpret
* **Verbose** — flooded with false positives, confusing non-technical users

As a result, vulnerabilities are often discovered **after an attack occurs**.

* **Automated risk detection** for websites, APIs, and public-facing systems
* **Clear impact-based reporting** highlighting business and operational risks
* **Actionable remediation steps** tailored to startup environments
* **Continuous monitoring** with smart alerts to prevent alert fatigue
