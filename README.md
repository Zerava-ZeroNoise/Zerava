Zerava — Zero noise. Real security.
Zerava is a lightweight cybersecurity platform designed to help startups and small teams identify and fix critical security risks before they turn into costly breaches.

With a single click, Zerava scans websites, APIs, and public-facing systems and delivers clear, actionable security insights written in plain, founder-friendly language.
